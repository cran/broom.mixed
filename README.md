This package is a spin-off from the [broom package](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom) for tidying output of statistical models; it imports basic functionality from `broom` and implements particular methods to handle a wide class of mixed (hierarchical, multi-level) models. The intention is that this package should eventually take over (i.e. this functionality will migrate out of `broom` completely and be kept here instead).
